    # Never remove below bindings. We need these bindings because they will:
    # 1. Ensure kcc-eng group has admin access to the billing account.
    # 2. Make sure our integration test service account can run tests against this billing account.
    # 3. Ensure the default admin account john@configconnector.joonix.net is kept unchanged.
